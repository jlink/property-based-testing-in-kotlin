# Property-based Testing in Kotlin

#### Last Update: July 30, 2024

Kotlin is currently the most hyped language on the JVM. With good reason.
Most parts of Kotlin are fully compatible with Java. 
Moreover, the language comes with a nice set of features 
to make programming on the JVM less burdensome and more functional.

However, there is not much coverage of _Property-based Testing_ (PBT) focusing on Kotlin.
Some of the few articles and resources I found are

- [A short blog series](https://medium.com/default-to-open/property-based-testing-in-kotlin-part-1-56929927b8b8)
- [A chapter of "The Joy of Kotlin"](https://livebook.manning.com/book/the-joy-of-kotlin/b-property-based-testing-in-kotlin/v-8/156)
- [A Guide to Property-Based Testing in Kotlin](https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin/property-based-testing)

__This article__ wants to fill the gap a little bit. 
It covers the application of PBT in Kotlin using 
[jqwik](https://jqwik.net) and [jqwik's Kotlin module](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html#kotlin-module).

#### Update

In May 2022 I was a guest on JetBrains' Kotlin YouTube channel talking about the PBT with Kotlin.
You may want to [watch the recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPhZIo27fYE) 
hopefully being motivated by it to read on.

## A Short Intro to PBT

You all know example-based tests, at least I hope you do. 
This is a typical example test using [JUnit Jupiter](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/):

```kotlin
@Test
fun `any list with elements can be reversed`() {
   val original : List<Int> = listOf(1, 2, 3)
   assertThat(original.reversed()).containsExactly(3, 2, 1)
}
```

One of the problems with example-based tests: They often promise more than they can keep.
Although they typically cover only a few examples, 
they would rather be able to ensure that the code works for _all valid input_.

Property-based tests, however, focus on common _properties_ (hence the name) of the code under test.
While it's not straightforward to predict the outcome of an arbitrary list's reversal without re-implementing reverse in your test,
there are a few things that should be true nonetheless:

- Reversing does not change the number of elements, nor the elements themselves
- Reversing twice will recreate the original list
- Reversing will swap the first element with the last, if there are at least two elements in the list

Here's how you could translate that into corresponding property-based tests using jqwik:

```kotlin
@Property
fun `reversing keeps all elements`(@ForAll list: List<Int>) {
    assertThat(list.reversed()).containsAll(list)
}

@Property
fun `reversing twice results in original list`(@ForAll list: List<Int>) {
    assertThat(list.reversed().reversed()).isEqualTo(list)
}

@Property
fun `reversing swaps first and last`(@ForAll @Size(min=2) list: List<Int>) {
    val reversed = list.reversed()
    assertThat(reversed[0]).isEqualTo(list[list.size - 1])
    assertThat(reversed[list.size - 1]).isEqualTo(list[0])
}
```

When you run these tests through your IDE or Maven or Gradle, 
each function will be executed 1000 times.
Each execution will be different, though, since jqwik generates a new list for each _try_ (a single execution of the property method).
You will see later, how succeeding and failing property runs are reported.

To be frank, the _Reverse List_ example is notorious and also rather boring. 
If this is your first encounter with PBT, you should definitely get more motivation from other sources.
Here are two articles to get you started, one of them from myself:

- [In praise of property-based testing](https://increment.com/testing/in-praise-of-property-based-testing/)
- [Know for Sure](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/know-for-sure-with-property-based-testing)


## jqwik and the JUnit Platform

As you have seen above _jqwik_ follows JUnit's lead in using an annotation (`@Property`) 
to mark a plain function as an executable property. 
This is not as common in the Kotlin world as it is in Java, 
but you all know it from years of JUnit anyway.

Another thing that jqwik does for you is to use the types of parameters annotated with `@ForAll`
to select an appropriate _generator_ for this parameter.
For example, the parameter `@ForAll aList: List<Int>` will generate lists of `Int` objects for you.
Many generators come with associated annotations to configure, restrict and influence them.

Let's look at a more complicated property:

```kotlin
@Property(tries = 100)
fun `can add up to 10 team members to a project`(
    @ForAll projectName: @NotBlank @NumericChars String,
    @ForAll emails: @Size(max = 10) @UniqueElements List<@Email String>
) {
    val project = Project(projectName)
    val users = emails.map { User(it) }.toList()
    for (user in users) {
        project.addMember(user)
    }
    for (user in users) {
        assertThat(project.isMember(user)).isTrue
    }
}
```

In this example you can see that configuration annotations can be added to type parameters, too.
In this property I've also changed the number of _tries_, which is 1000 by default, to 100.

_jqwik_ is not an independent library, but it comes as a _test engine_ for the 
[JUnit platform](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#overview-what-is-junit-5).

## Setting Up jqwik for Kotlin

Despite its original focus on Java, jqwik has worked well with Kotlin for a long time.
As of version `1.6.0` there's an additional Kotlin module which makes the experience even smoother.

If you're already using JUnit 5, the set up for jqwik is really easy: 
Just add a dependency to `jqwik.net:jqwik-kotlin:<version>`. 
In practice, I recommend adding a few compiler options to make your life easier.
Here's how you can do that in a Gradle build file using the Kotlin syntax:

```
tasks.withType<KotlinCompile> {
    kotlinOptions {
        freeCompilerArgs = listOf(
		  "-Xjsr305=strict", // Strict interpretation of nullability annotations in jqwik API
		  "-Xemit-jvm-type-annotations" // Enable nnotations on type variables
		)
        jvmTarget = "17" // 1.8 or above
        javaParameters = true // Get correct parameter names in jqwik reporting
    }
}
```

See 
[jqwik-starter-gradle-kotlin](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik-samples/tree/main/jqwik-starter-gradle-kotlin) 
and
[jqwik-starter-maven-kotlin](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik-samples/tree/main/jqwik-starter-maven-kotlin)
for fully configured examples for Gradle and Maven.

## Success, Failure and Shrinking

Now that you can run your own properties it's worthwhile to look at jqwik's reporting capabilities. 
When we run this property from above:

```kotlin
@Property
fun `reversing keeps all elements`(@ForAll list: List<Int>) {
    assertThat(list.reversed()).containsAll(list)
}
```

it runs successfully, thereby producing the following output:

```
ReverseProperties:reversing keeps all elements = 
                              |-------------------jqwik-------------------
tries = 1000                  | # of calls to property
checks = 1000                 | # of not rejected calls
generation = RANDOMIZED       | parameters are randomly generated
after-failure = PREVIOUS_SEED | use the previous seed
when-fixed-seed = ALLOW       | fixing the random seed is allowed
edge-cases#mode = MIXIN       | edge cases are mixed in
edge-cases#total = 10         | # of all combined edge cases
edge-cases#tried = 10         | # of edge cases tried in current run
seed = -8839434152225186972   | random seed to reproduce generated values
```

With the default [configuration](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html#jqwik-configuration) 
this report will be published for each and every property.
It tells you how often a property function has been started (`tries`), 
how often it has actually been evaluated (`checks`),
the random `seed` that can be used for replicating the exact same generated test data,
and other information of lesser importance.

Let's see what happens when a property run fails.
The following property suggests that `list.reversed()` does not change the list at hand - 
which is, of course, wrong and leads to a failing property run:

```kotlin
@Property
fun `reversing keeps the list unchanged`(@ForAll list: List<Int>) {
    assertThat(list.reversed()).isEqualTo(list)
}
```

Running it produces a report similar to this:

```
ReverseProperties:reversing keeps the list unchanged = 
  org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:
    expected: [0, 1]
     but was: [1, 0]

                              |-------------------jqwik-------------------
tries = 1                     | # of calls to property
checks = 1                    | # of not rejected calls
generation = RANDOMIZED       | parameters are randomly generated
after-failure = PREVIOUS_SEED | use the previous seed
when-fixed-seed = ALLOW       | fixing the random seed is allowed
edge-cases#mode = MIXIN       | edge cases are mixed in
edge-cases#total = 10         | # of all combined edge cases
edge-cases#tried = 0          | # of edge cases tried in current run
seed = -5786297582797313483   | random seed to reproduce generated values

Shrunk Sample (11 steps)
------------------------
  list: [0, 1]

Original Sample
---------------
  list:
    [
      -5459970, -113449, -15929, 151198, -657, -50279, 47614, 5813, 972, ...
    ]
```

In addition to the `AssertionFailedError` two sets of data are being shown:
the _shrunk sample_ and the _original sample_.
Both show data that make the property fail. 
Whereas the latter is (pseudo-)randomly generated, the _shrunk sample_ is the result of _shrinking_ the original set of values.
_Shrinking_ is PBT lingo for taking the original failing sample, making it "smaller" in relation to an internal size metric, 
and re-running the property function with this simplified version.
This _shrinking phase_ continues until no smaller sample can be found.

Shrinking has two big advantages:
- It provides you with a sample that has less complexity and is therefore easier to reason about.
  In the ideal case, you now have the simplest failing set of values, with no accidental complexity.
- If it works perfectly - which it often does not - shrinking will consistently produce the exact same smallest sample.
  That means less non-determinism in your tests, which is an essential factor in continuous integration and delivery.

Shrinking is a major differentiator when it comes to comparing PBT libraries with each other.
Libraries usually follow one of two approaches:

- Users must define shrinking behaviour together with defining a generator.
  This requires additional effort but also allows for domain-specific, targeted shrinking.
- Shrinking behaviour is automatically derived from a generator's specification.
  This is more convenient for users but may result in worse shrinking results in some cases.

Another characteristic to differentiate between shrinking approaches is  
[type-based versus integrated shrinking](https://hypothesis.works/articles/integrated-shrinking/).

_jqwik_ is a strong proponent of shrinking being an intrinsic part of generation - 
with some tweaking possible.
It also comes with fully integrated shrinking.
For the user of a library that's the all-round carefree package, 
if it works as expected, which it usually does.
If you're interested in seeing the different shrinking performance of PBT libs in comparison have a look at 
[The Shrinking Challenge](https://github.com/jlink/shrinking-challenge).


## Generators (aka Arbitraries)

_jqwik_ comes with quite a few built-in generators for many of Java's and Kotlin's fundamental classes and types.
When it comes to your own programs, however, you'll soon have the desire to generate objects of your specific target domain.

### Configuration through Annotation

The simplest way to influence what your generators produce is by using specific annotations,
the purpose of which is to provide information about constraints.
You have already seen a few of those annotations:
- `@Size` can constraining the size of multi-value types like `List`, `Set`, arrays and others.
- `@StringLength` does what the name says.
- `@NotBlank` tells String generators to never generate blank Strings (empty or whitespace only).
- `@Email` to use an email-specifc String generator instead of the default one.

There are many more; and their number is constantly growing.
You can read about them in the user guide's chapter on 
[Constraining Default Generation](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html#constraining-default-generation)
and in the chapters about optional modules like 
[web](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html#web-module) and 
[time](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html#time-module).

Eventually you will have to admit, though, that the maintainers of jqwik will never be able 
to fulfill all your domain-specific needs.
Therefore, there must be a way to build generators of your own liking with _programming_,
as opposed to just _specifying_ them through types and annotations.


### Programming Generators

To "program" a domain-specific generator the procedure is usually as follows:
- Identify the base types from which to build your domain type.
- Choose and configure the generators for your base types.
- Map, filter and combine the base generators into building instances of your domain type.
- Use your domain type generators for composing more complex domain generators if necessary.

Although they are often called "generators", in jqwik the generator abstraction is represented by the interface `Arbitrary<T>`,
where `T` is the type of the values to generate.
Think of `Arbitrary<T>` as a shorthand for _factory of generators for arbitrary objects of type T_.
This abstraction comes with a lot of useful features to transform and combine it; 
functional programmers may even call it [_monadic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)).

Let's look at how to build an arbitrary for the `Player` type, 
which is supposed to represent participants of a card game:

```kotlin
data class Player(val nickname: String, val ranking: Int, val position: String)
```

I've chosen to use a data class here to make the code compact, 
not because it's necessarily the best option.
Using a fully fledged class would not change the approach towards building a generator.

#### Generate by Type

A `Player` has a nickname of type `String`, a ranking of type `Int` and a position that's also a `String`.
When all underlying types have generators built into jqwik 
(or [made available](#registering-generators-for-global-use) to jqwik) 
there's a very simple way for generating instances of a given type: just call `anyForType<T>`.
Let's try that with `Player`:

```kotlin
@Property
fun playersFromType(@ForAll("playersByType") player: Player) {
    println(player)
}

@Provide
fun playersByType() : Arbitrary<Player> = anyForType<Player>()
```

In this example you can see how to match a parameter with its specific generator 
by using a _provider function_:
1. Implement a function that returns an `Arbitrary<YourDomainType>`, 
2. position this function in the same container class as your property,
3. add annotation `@Provide` to the function
4. and use the function's name as value in the parameter's `ForAll` annotation.

Often, the explicit return type can be left out, 
since it will be automatically inferred by the Kotlin compiler. 
Mind that in this exact example either the function's return type 
or the explicit type parameter of `anyForType<Player>()` is necessary.

When we run this example, the output will look something like

```
Player(nickname=秨ㅋ綞蛈蒅천綃붯ⷊ䴊츋㗨ঽ䛵粅⟌ఘᘍ슀ΐ읛핢뾴㤅㾣행⢯䫗臼힛⌆, ranking=11322, position=舶紭䜫᤬૚诖녅슎扮葱)
Player(nickname=蛈蒅천綃붯ⷊ䴊츋, ranking=105341, position= )
Player(nickname=천綃붯ⷊ, ranking=2147483647, position= )
Player(nickname=붯ⷊ䴊츋㗨ঽ䛵粅⟌, ranking=-2631, position=㾣행跎)
Player(nickname=䴊츋㗨ঽ, ranking=1733, position=읛핢뾴㤅)
Player(nickname=츋㗨ঽ䛵粅⟌, ranking=-2631, position=㾣행跎)
Player(nickname=㗨ঽ䛵粅⟌ఘᘍ슀, ranking=1439489, position=宄඄)
Player(nickname=䛵粅⟌ఘᘍ슀ΐ읛핢뾴㤅擪떏旀椼¤ꤊ翿咢잖趝ᢉᱜ纁틏Ⴧ萚ۊᬙ휘痩뻩븦䧗輮䯟䀺엮Ȣ﮸Ĉ寶倅撿ӗᶗ, ranking=-3183, position=痩뻩)
Player(nickname=粅⟌ఘᘍ, ranking=-12, position=행)
Player(nickname=⟌, ranking=-2631, position=㾣행跎)
...
```

Without further information, jqwik will generate 
- an _arbitrary_ string as `nickname` and `position` - 
  even empty strings or unprintable Unicode chars are within range
- an _arbitrary_ number of type `Int` - negatives and zero are possible

This might be what you want; 
in many cases, however, meaningful domain values are more restricted 
than what the plain Kotlin or Java type can tell us.

#### Choosing Constrained Base Arbitraries

Let's assume the following constraints for a player's attributes must hold:
- Nicknames must have a length of 1 to 12 characters.
- Nicknames can only contain English uppercase and lowercase letters as well as the digits `0` to `9`.
- A player's ranking can be between `0` and `999`.
- There are only three possible positions in our card game: `dealer`, `forehand` and `middlehand`

This is all we need to know to come up with our three base generators:

```kotlin
fun nicknames() : Arbitrary<String> = String.any().alpha().numeric().ofLength(1..12)
fun rankings() : Arbitrary<Int> = Int.any(0..999)
fun positions() : Arbitrary<String> = Arbitraries.of("dealer", "forehand", "middlehand")
```

Having those three in place we just combine them into a provider function for players:

```kotlin
@Provide
fun players() = combine(nicknames(), rankings(), positions()) {n, r, p -> Player(n, r, p)}
```

or even more compact, but in my opinion less readable:

```kotlin
@Provide
fun players() = combine(nicknames(), rankings(), positions(), ::Player)
```

Running the property now

```kotlin
@Property
fun validPlayers(@ForAll("players") player: Player) {
    println(player)
}
```

produces something more to our liking:

```
Player(nickname=a, ranking=2, position=dealer)
Player(nickname=A, ranking=0, position=dealer)
Player(nickname=z, ranking=0, position=dealer)
Player(nickname=RwClZUm7fPQ, ranking=999, position=forehand)
Player(nickname=7ggjAy1RK, ranking=721, position=forehand)
Player(nickname=z, ranking=0, position=dealer)
Player(nickname=TyfnGRbpqav1, ranking=234, position=dealer)
Player(nickname=TGuRgQ1MO03, ranking=2, position=dealer)
Player(nickname=0, ranking=38, position=dealer)
Player(nickname=5F, ranking=5, position=middlehand)
...
```

### Configuring, Transforming and Combining Arbitraries

With the `combine` function we have already seen one of the fundamental ways 
to use several arbitraries together for building another one.
There's much more, though, that can be done with arbitraries.

#### Configuration through Fluent API

Most built-in arbitrary types come with a fluent configuration API.
Let's take String generation as an example.
Calling `Arbitraries.strings()` - or the convenience equivalent `String.any()` - 
returns an instance of `StringArbitrary`,
which offers many useful functions to influence its generating behaviour:

```java
public interface StringArbitrary extends Arbitrary<String> {
	StringArbitrary ofMaxLength(int maxLength);
	StringArbitrary ofMinLength(int minLength);
	StringArbitrary ofLength(int length);
	StringArbitrary withChars(char... chars);
	StringArbitrary withChars(CharSequence chars);
	StringArbitrary withCharRange(char from, char to);
	StringArbitrary ascii();
	StringArbitrary alpha();
	StringArbitrary numeric();
	StringArbitrary whitespace();
	StringArbitrary all();
	StringArbitrary excludeChars(char ... charsToExclude);
	StringArbitrary withLengthDistribution(RandomDistribution lengthDistribution);
    StringArbitrary repeatChars(double repeatProbability);
}
```

Creating an arbitrary for Strings of length 2 to 42 with just ascii chars looks like:

```kotlin
Arbitraries.strings().ascii().ofMinLength(2).ofMaxLength(42)
```

The Kotlin module often adds extension functions to make using the API smoother.
Thus, we can rewrite the code above as:

```kotlin
String.any().ascii().ofLength(2..42)
```

You'll find configurable arbitraries for Strings, characters, numbers, collections, 
dates, times and many others.
The Kotlin module adds APIs for `IntRange` and `Sequence`.
To get a feeling for the breadth of available options look at 
[this section](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html#customized-parameter-generation)
in jqwik's user guide.


### Transforming Individual Arbitraries

Having an existing generator of type `Arbitrary<T>` allows you to do many useful things with it.
Here's a selection of useful functions in interface `Arbitrary`:

```java
public interface Arbitrary<T> {
  Arbitrary<T> filter(Predicate<T> filterPredicate);
  <U> Arbitrary<U> map(Function<T, U> mapper);
  <U> Arbitrary<U> flatMap(Function<T, Arbitrary<U>> mapper);
  Arbitrary<@NullableType T> injectNull(double nullProbability);
  ListArbitrary<T> list();
  SetArbitrary<T> set();
  StreamArbitrary<T> stream();
  IteratorArbitrary<T> iterator();
  <A> ArrayArbitrary<T, A> array(Class<A> arrayClass);
  Arbitrary<Optional<T>> optional();
}
```

#### Filtering

Filtering is about including values that fulfill a condition.
Use the following snippet for generating only even numbers between 2 and 100000:

```kotlin
Int.any(2..100000).filter {it % 2 == 0}
```

#### Mapping

Mapping is about using a generated value to produce another one.
This enables a different approach for even numbers between 2 and 100000:

```kotlin
Int.any(2..50000).map {it * 2}
```

You can map to different types, too. 
Here's an example for creating the HEX value of an integer:

```kotlin
Int.any(1..Int.MAX_VALUE).map { it.toString(16) }
```

### Creating Collections and other Multi-Value Types

Lists, sets, arrays etc. are very common when it comes to building domain specific data types.
Therefore, it should be easy to generate those as well - and it is:
Just use `list()`, `set()`, `stream()`, `iterator()` or `array(..)`.

Here's how you build a generator for lists of 10 doubles:

```kotlin
Double.any().list().ofSize(10)
```

Due to the existence of primitive array types in Java, the creation of arrays requires more ceremony:

```kotlin
Double.any().array(Array<Double>::class.java).ofSize(10)
```

In Kotlin, we have a bit more flexibility, so here's the version using an extension method
that saves you two characters:

```kotlin
Double.any().array<Double, Array<Double>>().ofSize(10)
```

You decide which one you prefer.

### Flat Mapping

_Flat Mapping_ is one of the magic words you should consider injecting 
into your conversation with the functional crowd - if you want to belong.
The idea behind it is straightforward: 
Instead of using a (generated) value to produce another value, which is a plain _map_,
you produce another _arbitrary_ instead.

Why is that useful?
Now and then you want to generate several arbitrary values together. 
However, the values are not independent of each other, 
but there's some condition linking two or more values.

Imagine you had to verify that `List<T>.index(t)` returns the correct index 
for elements that are present in the list.
Here's a property trying to check that quality:

```kotlin
@Property
fun `index works for element in list`(@ForAll list: List<Int>, @ForAll index: Int) {
    val element = list[index]
    assertThat(list.indexOf(element)).isEqualTo(index)
}
```

Maybe you've already expected the failure:

```
FlatMappingExamples:index works for element in list = 
  java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException:
    Index 0 out of bounds for length 0

Shrunk Sample (2 steps)
-----------------------
  list: []
  index: 0
```

The problem at hand: the generated value for _index_ does not consider the number of elements 
in the generated list; but it should.
Flat mapping comes to our rescue here:

```kotlin
@Property
fun `index works for element in list`(@ForAll("listWithValidIndex") listWithIndex: Pair<List<Int>, Int>) {
    val (list, index) = listWithIndex
    val element = list[index]
    assertThat(list.indexOf(element)).isEqualTo(index)
}

@Provide
fun listWithValidIndex() : Arbitrary<Pair<List<Int>, Int>> {
    val lists = Int.any().list().ofMinSize(1)
    return lists.flatMap { list -> Int.any(0 until list.size).map { index -> Pair(list, index) } }
}
```

The magic happens in the `return` statement:
The size of the generated `list` is used to constrain the upper border of the index generator.
The final trick is to return the two values, the `list` and the `index`, together as a `Pair`.

Surprisingly - at least I didn't expect it - the property still fails:

```
FlatMappingExamples:index works for element in list = 
  org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:
    expected: 1
     but was: 0
     
Shrunk Sample (86 steps)
------------------------
  listWithIndex: ([0, 0], 1)
```

The property does not consider duplicate elements in the list.
One way to get rid of that problem is to make sure elements are unique:

```kotlin
@Provide
fun listWithValidIndex() : Arbitrary<Pair<List<Int>, Int>> {
    val lists = Int.any().list().uniqueElements().ofMinSize(1)
    return lists.flatMap { list -> Int.any(0 until list.size).map { index -> Pair(list, index)} }
}
```

Et voilà, everything's running fine now.


### Assumptions

In a way, flat mapping over arbitraries is a rather involved way to deal with data dependencies.
A simpler and sometimes more natural way to reach the same goal are assumptions.
An assumption is a filter that can use all parameters of a property function: 

```kotlin
@Property
fun `index works for element in lis`(
      @ForAll @UniqueElements list: List<Int>, 
      @ForAll index: Int
) {
    Assume.that(index >= 0 && index < list.size)
    val element = list[index]
    assertThat(list.indexOf(element)).isEqualTo(index)
}
```

Here, the line `Assume.that(index >= 0 && index < list.size)` makes sure 
that only if `index` is in the valid range, the property will proceed to run the check.
This filtering out can, however, lead to a lot of test cases 
that are generated but thrown away afterwards as invalid.
If too many are thrown away, jqwik will complain and fail:

```
Property [FlatMappingExamples:index works for element in list - using assumption] exhausted after [1000] tries and [930] rejections
```

We can mitigate that problem by constraining the initial set of generated test cases; 
for example like that:

```kotlin
@Property
fun `index works for element in list`(
    @ForAll @UniqueElements @Size(max = 50) list: List<Int>,
    @ForAll @JqwikIntRange(max = 49) index: Int
) {
    //...
}
```

This should succeed; 
but still, the report shows that more than half of the generated test cases are being thrown away:

```
FlatMappingExamples:index works for element in list = 
                              |-------------------jqwik-------------------
tries = 1000                  | # of calls to property
checks = 463                  | # of not rejected calls
```

Conclusion: Be careful with assumptions that throw away (too) many generated samples.


### Combining Generators

We've already seen the most common way to combine two or more arbitraries.
The pattern, which scales up to 8 arbitraries, looks as follows:

```kotlin
val arbitrary1: Arbitrary<T1> = ...
val arbitrary2: Arbitrary<T2> = ...
val arbitrary3: Arbitrary<T3> = ...

combine(arbitrary1, arbitrary2, arbitrary3) { t1, t2, t3 ->
    // return a value that uses t1 through t3 for its own creation
}
```

If you need `t1..n` to configure another generator `flatCombine(..)` 
is what you can use.

There is another way to do something similar using a _builder_-based approach.
_Builders_ collect information required for construction - often in functions starting `with...` -
and then create the desired result type in a single step, e.g. by calling `build()`.
Using that approach the `Player` example from above could look as follows:

```kotlin
class PlayerBuilder() {
    fun withNickname(nickname: String): PlayerBuilder {...}

    fun withRanking(ranking: Int): PlayerBuilder {...}

    fun withPosition(position: String): PlayerBuilder {...}

    fun build() : Player {...}
}
```

```kotlin
@Provide
fun players() : Arbitrary<Player> {
    val builder = Builders.withBuilder { PlayerBuilder() }
    return builder
        .use(nicknames()) {b, n -> b.withNickname(n)}
        .use(rankings()) {b, r -> b.withRanking(r)}
        .use(positions()) {b, p -> b.withPosition(p)}
        .build { it.build()}
}
```

Using `Builders.withBuilder(..)` makes sense if:
- You already have builder classes for your domain type
- You have more than 8 attributes to combine
- You consider the builder syntax to be more readable

In the end `combine(..)` and builders are equivalent; 
sometimes one tends to be more concise (i.e. less code) than the other.


### Providing Generators through Domain Contexts

In most examples you've seen so far, arbitraries were handed in through provider functions.
This is convenient, since it allows us to have the specification of generated data 
close to the property function itself.

One thing with this approach is difficult, though: 
Sharing generators across container classes is not straightforward.
You _could_ move common generation logic into a helper class 
and then delegate to this class from provider functions.
Provider functions _must_ reside in the class of the property function, or in a supertype, 
or in the case of nested inner classes in one of its containing classes.

Enter jqwik's concept of _domains_: 

A "domain" is a collection of arbitrary providers and configurators that belong together.
In concrete programming terms:
- It's a class that has to implement `net.jqwik.api.domains.DomainContext` or, in most cases,
  that extends `net.jqwik.api.domains.DomainContextBase`.
- Such a domain context implementation is considered for property functions,
  if the function or its container class has the annotation `@Domain(MyDomainContext::class)`.

When a domain context class extends `DomainContextBase` the simplest way to provide a generator
is by moving the provider function from your properties class to the context class, 
the `@Provide` annotation included.

#### The Poker Domain

To demonstrate this, I've chosen Poker, the card game, as an example.
It comes with four domain types:
- `enum class Suit`: SPADES, HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS
- `enum class Rank`: TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING, ACE
- `data class PlayingCard(val suit: Suit, val rank: Rank)`
- `data class Hand(val cards: List<PlayingCard>)`

What we'll need to generate for testing a Poker engine or a Poker AI are:
- Individual playing cards, chosen randomly out of the 52 possible cards
- A full deck of 52 cards, shuffled
- Valid Hands of 5 cards with no duplicates
- Two or more hands out of a deck
- etc.

All these generators can be placed as functions in a domain context class:

```kotlin
class PokerDomain : DomainContextBase() {
  @Provide
  fun cards(): Arbitrary<PlayingCard> =
    combine(Enum.any(), Enum.any()) { s: Suit, r: Rank ->
      PlayingCard(s, r)
    }.withoutEdgeCases()

  @Provide
  fun decks(): Arbitrary<List<PlayingCard>> {
    return cards().list().uniqueElements().ofSize(52)
  }

  @Provide
  fun hands(): Arbitrary<Hand> {
    return decks().map { deck: List<PlayingCard> -> Hand(deck.subList(0, 5)) }
  }

  @Provide
  fun pairOfHands(): Arbitrary<Pair<Hand, Hand>> {
    return decks().map { deck: List<PlayingCard> ->
      val first = Hand(deck.subList(0, 5))
      val second = Hand(deck.subList(5, 10))
      Pair(first, second)
    }
  }
}
```

In addition to the `@Provide` annotation, the return type of the provider function 
plays an important role:
The variable part inside `Arbitrary<..>` is used to match the type 
of a property function's for-all-parameter.
Provider functions in domains supersede standard rules for generating lists, sets and so on.
That means that `@Provide fun decks(): Arbitrary<List<PlayingCard>>` 
will be used for all lists of `PlayingCard`s;
constraining annotations like `@Size` do not work on them.

With class `PokerDomain` in place property functions can simply use 
the type of values they want to be generated:

```kotlin
@Domain(PokerDomain::class)
class PokerProperties {

  @Property
  fun `all 52 possible cards are generated`(@ForAll card: PlayingCard) {
    Statistics.collect(card)
  }

  @Property
    fun `shuffled decks are generated`(@ForAll deck: List<PlayingCard>) {
        assertThat(deck).hasSize(52)
        assertThat(HashSet(deck)).hasSize(52)
    }

    @Property
    fun `a hand has 5 unique cards`(@ForAll hand: Hand) {
        assertThat(hand.show()).hasSize(5)
        assertThat(HashSet(hand.show())).hasSize(5)
    }

    @Property
    fun `two hands dont share cards`(@ForAll twoHands: Pair<Hand, Hand>) {
        val first = twoHands.first
        val second = twoHands.second
        assertThat(first.show()).hasSize(5)
        assertThat(second.show()).hasSize(5)
        assertThat(first.show()).doesNotContainAnyElementsOf(second.show())
    }
}
```

These verify that the generators work as expected.
The first one does the verification by collecting statistical values about
the frequency of cards being generated.
You might expect that 1000 tries will result in a more or less equal distribution of the 52 cards.
But something else is happening here, as we notice when looking at the report:

```
[PokerProperties:all 52 possible cards are generated] (52) statistics = 
    FOUR of HEARTS    (1) :  2 %
    JACK of SPADES    (1) :  2 %
    ..
    TWO of SPADES     (1) :  2 %
    KING of HEARTS    (1) :  2 %

PokerProperties:all 52 possible cards are generated = 
                              |-------------------jqwik-------------------
tries = 52                    | # of calls to property
checks = 52                   | # of not rejected calls
...
```

The property function was run exactly 52 times - instead of 1000 times, 
and each card was generated exactly once!
That cannot be a coincidence - and it is none.

What we see here is __exhaustive generation__:
Whenever jqwik is able to figure out that generating all possible values results
in fewer tries than the standard number of tries, 
it's going for all possible values and then stops.
We can switch this behaviour off by adding an attribute to our annotation:

```
@Property(generation = GenerationMode.RANDOMIZED) 
fun `all 52 possible cards are generated`(@ForAll card: PlayingCard) {...}
```

Running the property again shows a "more random" distribution:

```
[PokerProperties:all 52 possible cards are generated] (1000) statistics = 
    SIX of SPADES     (29) :  3 %
    FIVE of CLUBS     (27) :  3 %
    TEN of HEARTS     (27) :  3 %
    FIVE of DIAMONDS  (27) :  3 %
    ...
    EIGHT of CLUBS    (12) :  1 %
    QUEEN of SPADES   (10) :  1 %
```

With the generators in `PokerDomain` in place,
you now have the tools to start implementing and testing the actual Poker engine!

#### Advanced Usage of Domains

There's one caveat with `@Domain` you should be aware of: 
As soon as you apply at least one domain to your property or property class, 
all built-in generators for strings, numbers etc. are no longer available by default.
To enable them you have to additionally add `@Domain(DomainContext.Global::class)`.
Since Kotlin does not support repeatable annotations (yet),
adding more than one annotation looks a bit cumbersome:

```kotlin
@DomainList(
    Domain(PokerDomain::class),
    Domain(DomainContext.Global::class)
)
```

Provider functions are just the simplest way of adding generators to a domain.
A domain can also have full-fledged arbitrary providers and arbitrary configurators.
Look at [Domain and Domain Contexts](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html#domain-and-domain-context)
in jqwik's user guide to learn about the full functionality of domain contexts
and `DomainContextBase`.


### Registering Generators for Global Use

Last but not least, there is one more way to provide an arbitrary for a given type:
You can register a global `ArbitraryProvider` implementation.
If you would like, for example, to generate a `PlayingCard` whenever this type is referenced 
in a for-all parameter, in any property function in your tests, 
all you need is this class:

```kotlin
class PlayingCardArbitraryProvider : ArbitraryProvider {
    override fun canProvideFor(targetType: TypeUsage) = targetType.isAssignableFrom(PlayingCard::class)

    override fun provideFor(
        targetType: TypeUsage,
        subtypeProvider: ArbitraryProvider.SubtypeProvider
    ): Set<Arbitrary<out Any>> {
        val suit = Enum.any<Suit>()
        val rank = Enum.any<Rank>()
        return setOf(combine(suit, rank, ::PlayingCard).withoutEdgeCases())
    }
}
```

and [register it as a service provider](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html#providing-default-arbitraries)
in `META-INF/services/net.jqwik.api.providers.ArbitraryProvider`.

## Finding Good Properties

The mechanics of writing and running properties is one side of the coin.
The other side, and arguably the more important one, is to find good properties 
and to integrate Property-based testing into your development process.

PBT and its [first implementation QuickCheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) 
have been around for over 20 years. 
During that time quite a few patterns and strategies have been discovered 
to find good and useful properties.
Here's my personal list of strategies to choose from:

- Fuzzying
- Postconditions
- Inductive Testing
- Metamorphic Properties
- Black-box Testing
- Test Oracle
- Stateful Testing
- Model-based Properties

It's beyond the scope of this article to cover these to any useful degree of detail.
That's why I'll provide you with a few pointers further down.
One category, however, is so different from how we are used to thinking about example-based tests
that I want to at least scratch its surface: _Metamorphic Properties_.

### Metamorphic Properties

In his seminal paper ["How to Specify it!"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tx2b84kae4bw1p4/paper.pdf), 
John Huges introduces __Metamorphic Properties__ like this:

> "… even if the expected result of a function call […] may be difficult to predict, 
> we may still be able to express an expected relationship between this result, 
> and the result of a related call."

Since this is a very generic statement I want to translate it into a concrete example:
_When I know the result of summing up an arbitrary set of numbers,
then the sum of these numbers __and__ an additional number X is the original sum plus X._

Formulated as a jqwik property, this could look like:

```kotlin
fun sumUp(vararg numbers: Int) = numbers.sum()

@Property
fun `sum is enhanced by X`(@ForAll list: IntArray, @ForAll x: Int) : Boolean {
    val original = sumUp(*list)
    val sum = sumUp(*list, x)
    return sum == original + x
}
```

The basic idea behind metamorphic properties is behind some of the better known patterns
like "inverse operations", "idempotence" and "commutativity", 
all of which are described in the articles listed below.

### Further Material

Here are the promised links to earlier articles of mine
to get you started with techniques for finding good properties:

- [Patterns to Find Properties](https://blog.johanneslink.net/2018/07/16/patterns-to-find-properties/)
- [Stateful Testing](https://blog.johanneslink.net/2018/09/06/stateful-testing/)
- [How to Specify It! In Java](https://johanneslink.net/how-to-specify-it/)
- [Model-based Testing](https://blog.johanneslink.net/2020/03/11/model-based-testing/)
- [Property-driven Development](https://blog.johanneslink.net/2019/05/11/property-based-driven-development/)

Most examples in those articles use Java.
I trust you to make the translation to Kotlin without much hassle.

## jqwik's Kotlin Support

Most of the code examples we've seen so far, work with plain jqwik.
If they don't, it's usually due to a Kotlin convenience method like `String.any()`, 
which would translate to `Arbitraries.strings()` in jqwik's Java-based API.

Idiomatic Kotlin, however, is more than just converting Java code into Kotlin syntax. 
That's why - starting with version 1.6.0 - jqwik offers an optional Kotlin module with two main goals:
Smoothing off some rough edges when using the jqwik API in Kotlin 
and supporting (some of) the additional features that Kotlin brings to the table.

### Compatibility

_jqwik_ is compatible with Kotlin's syntax and its somewhat different view on Java's type system. 
That means that:

- You can use functions instead of methods; functions returning `false` indicate a failure.

- Kotlin allows function names - and even class names! - with spaces and a few other special characters;
  you have to use backticks for those names, though.

- You can use Kotlin's expression syntax for property functions, 
  which allows for very concise statements:
  
  ```kotlin
  @Property 
  fun `positive is above 0`(@ForAll @Positive anInt: Int) = anInt > 0
  ```

- You can also use Kotlin's `assert` function, which - unlike Java's built-in `assert` -
  is always evaluated. 
  That allows you to use _jqwik_ and other testing framework without any additional assertion library:
  
  ```kotlin
  @Property
  fun `negative is below 0`(@ForAll @Negative anInt: Int) {
    assert(anInt < 0, { "$anInt should be < 0" })
  }
  ```

- You can use all of Kotlin's array and collection types (and have them generated for you).

- You can use Kotlin function types instead of Java's lambdas and `@Functional` types.
  Thus, the following property works without the need for further configuration:

  ```kotlin
  @Property
  fun `all generated functions return a String`(
    @ForAll func: ((Int, Int) -> String),
    @ForAll int1: Int,
    @ForAll int2: Int
  ) {
    assertThat(func(int1, int2)).isInstanceOf(String::class.java)
  }
  ```

- You can use `internal` container classes and property methods.

- You can use Kotlin-style annotations and enums.

- You can use the different Kotlin ways to define types (data classes, sealed classes, type aliases etc.)
  as target types for generation or as test containers where it makes sense.

  Data classes lend themselves especially well for being used with `@UseType`,
  because data class constructors are automatically being considered as generator functions.
  Thus, the following example, which requires __jqwik 1.6.1__ or above, shows how data classes
  can be generated from just their type information.
  It also shows that parameter annotations are taken into consideration - just like in property methods. 

  ```kotlin
  class UseTypeWithDataclassesExamples {

    @Property(tries = 10)
    fun generateCommunications(@ForAll @UseType communication: Communication) {
        println(communication)
    }
  }

  data class Person(val firstName: String?, val @NotBlank lastName: String)

  data class User(val identity: Person, @Email val email: String)

  data class Communication(val from: User, val to: User)
  ```
  
  
- As a special trick you can use singleton objects as container classes:

  ```kotlin
  object MySingletonProperties {
    @Property
    fun prop1() {}

    @Property
    fun prop2() {}
  }
  ```
  
  In this case the lifecycle changes in so far as all invocations of property methods
  will share them same singleton instance as `this` reference, 
  which is similar to Jupiter's `TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS`.
  Sadly, IntelliJ does not recognize Kotlin's `object` definitions as test container classes
  in the editor.
  Running them through the project view, however, works as expected.

- You can use inner classes to nest test containers. 
  This requires the `@Group` annotation and also the modifier `inner`

  ```kotlin
  class OuterProperties {
    @Property
    fun outerProp() {}

    @Group
    inner class InnerProperties {
        @Property
        fun innerProp() {}
    }
  }
  ```

- One more thing: In Kotlin the context object (aka `this`) of a function can be enhanced.
  This allows property methods to have their own context type:

  ```kotlin
   val key = "a number"

   @Property
   fun Reporter.reportGeneratedNumbers(@ForAll aNumber: Int) {
       publishReport(key, aNumber) // This is a call to reporter.publishReport(..)
   }
  ```
   
  Since context objects are being translated to function parameters in Java bytecode,
  the context of type [`Reporter`]() will automatically being injected,
  if there is a registered [parameter resolver hook](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html#resolveparameterhook) 
  for this type of parameter.
  How cool is that?

### Nullability

Kotlin's default to not allow `null` values for plain types is one of its strong sides.
This goes well together with jqwik's strategy to never generate `null` unless explicitly told to do so.
Wouldn't it be nice if jqwik used Kotlin's nullability information, e.g. `String?`, 
to inject `null`s into generated values if and only if the type specifies it?

__The good news:__ Top-level nullable Kotlin types are recognized, 
i.e., `null`'s will automatically be generated with a probability of 5% in this example:

```kotlin
@Property
fun `also generate nulls`(@ForAll nullOrString: String?) {
    println(nullOrString)
}
```

If you want a different probability you have to use `@WithNull(probability)`.

__The bad news:__ The detection of nullable types only works for top-level types.
Using `@ForAll list: List<String?>` will __not__ result in `null` values within the list.
Nullability for type parameters must be explicitly set through `@WithNull`:

```kotlin
@Property(tries = 100)
fun `generate nulls in list`(@ForAll list: List<@WithNull String?>) {
    println(list)
}
```

### Convenience Methods

Using the Java API from Kotlin can feel rather awkward and involved.
That's why `jqwik-kotlin` comes with quite a few convenience functions.
Here's a selection:

- Instead of `Arbitraries.strings()`, `Arbitraries.integers()` etc. you can use
  a shorthand `String.any()`, `Int.any()` and so on.

- `Arbitrary.orNull(probability: Double) : T?` can replace `Arbitrary.injectNull(probability)`
  and returns a nullable type.

- `Arbitrary.array<T, A>()` can replace `Arbitrary.array(javaClass: Class<A>)`.

- In addition to `ofMinSize(..)` and `ofMaxSize(..)` all sizable 
  arbitraries can now be configured using `ofSize(min..max)`.

- In addition to `ofMinLength(..)` and `ofMaxLength(..)` a `StringArbitrary`
  can now be configured using `ofLength(min..max)`.

- Getting a type-based generator using the Java API looks a bit awkward in Kotlin:
  `Arbitraries.forType(MyType::class.java)`.
  There's a more Kotlinish way to do the same: `anyForType<MyType>()`.

- Similarly, generating enum values looks better like `Enum.any<EnumType> : Arbitrary<EnumType>` 
  than like `Arbitraries.of(EnumType::class.java)`.

- Combine comes as a top-level function now, e.g.:
  `combine(String.any(), Int.any(1..10)) { s, i -> s.repeat(i) }`

- `Builders.BuilderCombinator.use(arbitrary, combinator)` to simplify Java API call
  ```kotlin
  Builders.BuilderCombinator.use(arbitrary).`in`(combinator) 
  ```
  which requires backticks because `in` is a Kotlin keyword.

You can find a comprehensive documentation of convenience functions in  
[this section](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html#convenience-functions-for-kotlin)
of jqwik's user guide.


### Support for Kotlin SDK

The Kotlin standard library comes with a lot of types that don't have an equivalent in the JDK.
Some of them are already supported directly:

##### `IntRange`

- Create an `IntRangeArbitrary` through `IntRange.any()` or `IntRange.any(range)`

- Using `IntRange` as type in a for-all-parameter will auto-generate it.
  You can use annotations `@JqwikIntRange` and `@Size` in order to
  constrain the possible ranges.

##### `Sequence<T>`

- Create a `SequenceArbitrary` by using `.sequence()` on any other arbitrary,
  which will be used to generate the elements for the sequence.
  `SequenceArbitrary` offers similar configurability as most other multi-value arbitraries in jqwik.

- Using `Sequence` as type in a for-all-parameter will auto-generate it.
  You can use annotations @Size` in order to
  constrain number of values produced by the sequence.

Mind that jqwik will _never create infinite sequences_.

##### `Pair<A, B>`

- Create an instance of `Arbitrary<Pair<A, B>>` by using the global function
  `anyPair(a: Arbitrary<A>, b: Arbitrary<B>)`.

- Create an instance of `Arbitrary<Pair<T, T>>` by calling `arbitraryForT.pair()`.

- Using `Pair` as type in a for-all-parameter will auto-generate,
  thereby using the type parameters with their annotations to create the
  component arbitraries.

##### `Triple<A, B, C>`

- Create an instance of `Arbitrary<Triple<A, B, C>>` by using the global function
  `anyTriple(a: Arbitrary<A>, b: Arbitrary<B>, c: Arbitrary<C>)`.

- Create an instance of `Arbitrary<Triple<T, T, T>>` by calling `arbitraryForT.triple()`.

- Using `Triple` as type in a for-all-parameter will auto-generate,
  thereby using the type parameters with their annotations to create the
  component arbitraries.

If you are missing support for your favourite Kotlin class,
you are invited to [create an issue](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/new?title=Kotlin+SDK+Support:).

### Testing of Asynchronous Code

Another strong side of Kotlin is its support for 
[asynchronous, non-blocking code and co-routines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html).
In order to test suspending functions or coroutines the jqwik's Kotlin module offers two options:

- Use the global function `runBlockingProperty(..)`.

- Just add the `suspend` modifier to the property method.

```kotlin
suspend fun echo(string: String): String {
  delay(100)
  return string
}

@Property
fun `use runBlockingProperty`(@ForAll s: String) =
  runBlockingProperty {
    assertThat(echo(s)).isEqualTo(s)
  }

@Property
fun `use runBlockingProperty with context`(@ForAll s: String) =
  runBlockingProperty(EmptyCoroutineContext) {
    assertThat(echo(s)).isEqualTo(s)
  }

@Property
suspend fun `use suspend function`(@ForAll s: String) {
  assertThat(echo(s)).isEqualTo(s)
}
```

Both variants start the body of the property method asynchronously and wait for all coroutines to finish.
That means that delays will require the full amount of specified delay time and context switching,
which may push you towards a smaller number of tries if a property's execution time gets too high.

If you need more control over [dispatchers](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutine-context-and-dispatchers.html) 
or the handling of delays, you should consider using
[`kotlinx.coroutines` testing support](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/tree/master/kotlinx-coroutines-test).
This will require to add a dependency on `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-test`.


### Constraints and Quirks

Some things are not as smooth (yet) as I'd like them to be.
For example: Kotlin's unsigned integer types, as well as inline classes, 
do not show up on Java's byte code side _at all_. 
That means they are treated naively;
`UInt` as `Int` and an inlined class as the type it is inlining.
This also means that you cannot write generators for these types, only for their Java counterpart.

Kotlin's support for injecting the correct annotations in the byte code is not perfect yet - 
but improving with each version.
If you notice that a constraint annotation is sometimes not honoured by the generator,
this might be an open Kotlin bug.

## Kotest - An Alternative to jqwik

jqwik's Kotlin support has one big disadvantage: It's not fully multi-platform.
Since jqwik makes heavy use of Java's reflection mechanisms, it's bound to the JVM and Android platforms.
Thus, it's worthwhile to have a short look at a really platform-independent contender: 
[Kotest](https://kotest.io/docs/proptest/property-based-testing.html) 

Unlike jqwik (or JUnit) Kotest does not use annotations to mark test and property functions.
Instead, it uses _test styles_, which are functionally equivalent, 
each represented by a class that must be extended. 
I will use `StringSpec` as my style of choice here.

Let's look at the properties for `List.reversed()`, 
the jqwik implementation of which we have seen [above](#a-short-intro-to-pbt):

```kotlin
class KotestExamples : StringSpec({
    "reversing keeps all elements" {
        checkAll<List<Int>> { list ->
            assertThat(list.reversed()).containsAll(list)
        }
    }

    "reversing twice results in original list" {
        checkAll<List<Int>> { list ->
            assertThat(list.reversed().reversed()).isEqualTo(list)
        }
    }

    "reversing swaps first and last" {
        checkAll(Arb.list(Arb.int(), 1..100)) { list ->
            val reversed = list.reversed()
            assertThat(reversed[0]).isEqualTo(list[list.size - 1])
            assertThat(reversed[list.size - 1]).isEqualTo(list[0])
        }
    }
})
```

What we can see is that Kotest container classes have their test specifications in the constructor.
Moreover, there is the possibility to define generators by target type 
or by choosing them through functions on class `io.kotest.property.Arb`.

As of today (May 2022) Kotest's PBT feature set is considerably smaller than jqwik's.
Things that stand out here are: assumptions, state-based testing, recursive generators, edge cases, 
statistics and more effective shrinking.
If you are interested in the differences between the two
[Christoph's article](https://www.welcz.de/blog/2022/05/09/jqwik-at-first-glance-from-a-kotest-users-perspective/)
about his first steps with jqwik after using kotest for a while is a must-read.

Nevertheless, Kotest can be a good choice for getting into PBT when you're using it already,
or when you need a truly multi-platform library.

## Summary

Property-based testing is a valuable tool to enhance and partially replace example-based testing.
Generating domain-specific objects is as important as coming up with good properties to check.

jqwik, which originally is a Java library, comes with a Kotlin module to make its use with Kotlin smooth and comfortable.
